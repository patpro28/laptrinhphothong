Since his math teacher did not expect much from Tudor, he only needs to do some simple addition problems. However, simple for you and I may not be simple for Tudor , so please help him!\n\n## Input Specification\n\nThe first line will contain an integer $N$ ($1 \\le N \\le 100\\,000$), the number of addition problems Tudor needs to do. The next $N$ lines will each contain two space-separated integers whose absolute value is less than $1\\,000\\,000\\,000$, the two integers Tudor    needs to add.\n\n## Output Specification\n\nOutput $N$ lines of one integer each, the solutions to the addition problems in order.\n\n## Sample Input\n\n        2\n        1 1\n        -1 0\n\n## Sample Output\n\n        2\n        -1",
